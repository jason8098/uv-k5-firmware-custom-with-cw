# F4HWN Firmware with CW Beacon
This is an implementation/demo of the CW beacon. A custom string and speed in WPM can be set and it will chnage each charactors into the morse code tones while transmitting it.
PS: Bandscope was replcaed to this due to the capacity issue.

# Use Case
I made this mainly for the FOX HUNT beacon purposes. The modulation is FM, so most of all receivers, handhelds can receive it without any problem.
